# Clean unused system files

`pacman` and `yay` store different versions of packages and their dependencies in cache folders. Unused files, dependencies, and logs accumulate over time and should periodically be cleared to keep the system's disk space tidy.

## Clear `pacman` cache

By default, `pacman` stores package files in the `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` cache. This is a system-wide cache that can be accessed by helpers such as `yay`.

The `paccache` utility tool is used to remove old packages from the `pacman` cache while retaining the 3 most recent versions:

```sh
paccache -r
```

It is not recommended to delete all past versions unless disk space is really needed. Keeping previous versions prevents redundant downloads when downgrading or reinstalling packages.

| Terminal command  | Description             | 
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `paccache -r` | Clears the `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` cache of all packages while retaining the last 3 versions. |
| `paccache -ru` | Clears the `pacman` cache of **uninstalled** packages while retaining the last 3 versions. | 
| `paccache -ruk0` | Clears the `pacman` cache of all versions of **uninstalled** packages.
| `pacman -Sc` | Clears the `pacman` cache of all uninstalled packages and unused `pacman sync` databases. This isn't recommended for network-shared caches. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to clear the `pacman` and `yay` caches **every 1-2 months**. \

## Clear `yay` cache
`yay` maintains a separate user-specific cache for AUR packages and their build files. 

Use this command to clear all cached AUR packages and untracked files:

```sh
yay -Sc
```

`yay` will confirm which files of the cache it should remove. By default, it keeps all locally installed packages. `yay -Sc` is considered an extended `pacman` command and can also clear the `pacman` cache at the same time.

 <summary>Example <code>yay -Sc</code> output below:

 ```sh

## Clear `systemd` journal

`systemd` logs system activity in the journal and is used to troubleshoot issues. Open the journal by entering `journalctl` in a terminal.

To maintain a log of the past 6 weeks while clearing excess logs, run:

 ```sh
 journalctl --vacuum-time=6weeks
 ```

It is recommended to keep a minimum of **4 weeks** of logs, but the amount can be adjusted to personal preference. By default, the journal can only contain up to 4 GB of information.

## Remove orphan dependencies

**Orphans** are dependencies that are **no longer needed** by any program. These accumulate on the system when:

- Packages are uninstalled with `pacman -R <package-name>` instead of the more thorough `-Rs` option.

- A new package version no longer requires a dependency it originally used or was installed with.

This combined command will list orphans (unused package dependencies). After user confirmation, and recursively removes them along with their configuration files:

 ```sh
 sudo pacman -Qdtq | sudo pacman -Rns -
 ```

After running `sudo pacman -Qdtq | sudo pacman -Rns -`, enter `Y` to confirm removal of the listed orphans.

---

> [!TIP]\
> If the terminal outputs `error: argument '-' specified with empty stdin`, this means there are no orphans to remove.

If there are orphan dependencies that you wish to **keep**, specify beforehand which ones should be excluded from removal with this command:

 ```sh
 sudo pacman -D --asexplicit <pkg>
 ```

| Command      | Description         | 
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `sudo pacman -Qdtq` | Lists all orphan dependencies. This is useful for checking if there  are orphans that should be kept. |
| `sudo pacman -Rns <pkg>` | Removes a specified orphan. |
| `sudo pacman -D --asexplicit <pkg>` | Excludes the specified orphan from removal. |
