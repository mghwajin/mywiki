# System maintenance > Update system packages

## Overview

There are 3 basic commands that Endeavour OS users should regularly run to keep their system packages (programs, apps, libraries, etc.) up to date.

- [`sudo pacman -Syu`](#sudo-pacman--syu)
- [`yay`](#yay)
- [`eos-update`](#eos-update)
- [FAQs](#faqs)

## `sudo pacman -Syu`
`pacman` is the package manager used to install and update programs in Arch Linux. To perform a full system update and refresh, run:

 ```sh
 sudo pacman -Syu
 ```

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> It is recommended to update your system **daily** to ensure that system packages are up to date. This is important when a previous update had issues that were fixed or reverted.

Other basic `pacman` commands include: 
| Command            | Description           | 
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `pacman -S <pkg>`  | Installs the specific package. |
| `pacman -Rs <pkg>` | Removes a package and its dependencies. Using the `-Rs` option helps to prevent orphan dependencies. |
| `pacman -Ss <pkg>` | Searches for a specified package on the system. |
| `pacman -Qi <pkg>` | Retrieve a list of the dependencies a package needs to run. |

<!------------------------------------------------------>

## `yay`
`yay`<sup>[AUR][yay]</sup> stands for "yet another yogurt" and it is one of the most popular **AUR helpers** used in the Arch Linux community. It functions like the `pacman` package manager, simplifying the process of downloading, installing, updating, and removing AUR-specific software.
- *FAQ: [What is the Arch User Repository (AUR)?](#what-is-the-aur)*

To update the system's native and AUR packages, run:
```sh
yay
```
> [!IMPORTANT]\
> It is recommended to run `yay` at least every 1-2 weeks.

The terminal will list the packages available to upgrade and may ask for the user to select:
  1. Which package provider should be used (where to download files from)
  2. If any packages should be excluded from the upgrade
  3. If the Make dependencies should also be removed
  4. Etc.

 ```sh
 [user@computer ~]$ yay
 [sudo] password for user:

 :: Searching AUR for updates...
 :: There are 2 providers available for cargo:

 ```

> [!CAUTION]\
>  Do not run `yay` with root permissions (`sudo`), or it may cause accidental (and potentially fatal) system changes. The AUR helper does not require root permissions to manage packages.

</details>

> [!NOTE]\ 
> AUR packages are community-maintained and **unofficial**. It is highly recommended to check build files for any malicious code before installation.

## `eos-update`

Endeavour OS provides an optional update script that utilizes `pacman` and `yay` to run basic system updates with additional options.

```sh
eos-update
```

<details> 
 <summary><span>Here is a summary provided by running <code>eos-update --help</code> in the terminal:
 </summary>

 ```sh
 eos-update is a package updater for EndeavourOS and Arch.

 eos-update is implemented as a wrapper around commands pacman and optionally yay/paru.
 Essentially runs commands 'pacman -Syu' and optionally 'yay -Sua' or 'paru -Sua'.

 eos-update includes (by default) special help in the following situations:
 - A dangling pacman db lock file (/var/lib/pacman/db.lck).
 - Disk space availability for updates (with a configurable minimum space).
 - Keyring package updating before updating other packages.
 - Running the 'sync' command after update. 

 Optional help: 
 - Can clear package databases in case of constant problems with them.
 - Can reset keyrings in case of constant problems with them.
 - Can check the validity of the locally configured lists of mirrors.
 - Updates AUR packages (with option --helper, see Usage below).
 - Ad hoc check for Nvidia GPU driver vs. kernel updates (non-dkms only).
 ```
</details>

> [!TIP]\
> `eos-update` can be used in place of `yay` or `sudo pacman -Syu`.

User preference for update commands varies greatly. `eos-update` performs the same tasks as `yay` and `pacman -Syu` with an added layer of options.
 
Notably, running `eos-update` may be more helpful for users needing a quick fix to the system, and/or users who do not update the system frequently.

## FAQs

### Why am I getting errors when I try to update?

Some update errors are caused by issues with mirrors and mirrorlist configurations. These issues can be fixed by re-ranking mirrors.

> [!NOTE]\
> Outdated package databases will cause errors when `pacman` tries to retrieve the latest package files. This can be fixed through regular mirror maintenance.
> 
> See: [Update mirrors guide](Update-mirrors)

---

### Error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
Running a `sudo pacman -Syu` update may fail and display the following errors:

```sh
error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
<example>: /example exists in filesystem (owned by filesystem)
<example>: /lib/systemd/system/example.service exists in filesystem
```

These issues can be resolved with manual intervention. Uninstall and remove the package from the system, then reinstall:
```sh
sudo pacman -Rdd <example>
sudo pacman -Syu <example>
```

You can also uninstall/remove the package, then run a full system update with `pacman` instead.

---

### What does the `-Syu` option mean?
Here are some excerpts from the `pacman` manpage:

| `pacman` option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `-S, --sync` | Synchronize packages. Packages are installed directly from the remote repositories, including all dependencies required to run the packages. | 
| `-y, --refresh` | Download a fresh copy of the master package databases from the servers. This should typically be used each time you use --sysupgrade or -u. | 
| `-u, --sysupgrade` | Upgrades all packages that are out-of-date. Each currently-installed package will be examined and upgraded if a newer package exists. |

> [!NOTE]\
> See: [`pacman manpage`][pacman]

---

### What is the difference between `pacman -Syu` and `pacman -Syyu`?
The `-Syyu` option forces a refresh of all package databases, even if they appear to be up to date. This may sometimes be helpful when switching from broken to working mirrors.

However, it is not necessary to use "double" `pacman` commands in most circumstances. In the interest of keeping mirror bandwidth free for other users, they should only be used when necessary.

> [!NOTE]\
> See: [Mirrors: force `pacman` to refresh the package lists][force-refresh]

### What is the AUR?

AUR stands for the **Arch User Repository**, a large library of user community-produced packages for Arch Linux.

Popular and well-maintained packages are voted on by the community to include in the official Arch *extra* repository.

---

### How do I download and install AUR packages?

  Downloading and building an AUR package is fairly simple:
  
1. Clone the `git` repository listed on the package's AUR page:
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pkg.git
   ```

2. Change into the package directory:

    ```sh
    cd <pkg>
    ```

3. Build and install the package with:
   
   ```sh
   makepkg -si
   # or
   pacman -U pkg-version-1.0.1.pkg.tar.zst
   ```

> [!WARNING]\
> Always review the installation files (i.e. `PKGBUILD`) for any malicious code. Good user standing is required to maintain AUR packages, but this is not a foolproof preventative measure.
