# System maintenance > Create system backups

## Overview

System backups are created with `timeshift`, an important utility tool that creates "snapshots" of key system settings and files. 

These snapshots can be used to restore the system to a prior state if the current state becomes unbootable or unusable.

## How to create a snapshot

Create a snapshot **on demand** (unscheduled) by using:
 
 ```sh
 sudo timeshift --create
 ```

To first check if a snapshot is due, then create one if needed, use:

 ```sh
 sudo timeshift --check
 ```

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> It is highly recommended to create daily backups and before making changes to important system settings (such as config files).

## `timeshift` options

### Snapshot type

**RSYNC** snapshots are incremental copies of changed system files.
 -  Keeps hard-links for files unchanged from the previous snapshot.

 -  Take up more space but are much more simple to set up.

**BTRFS** snapshots are only available on systems that are set up with a BTRFS file system.
 - Much quicker and space-efficient.

 - Requires more technical knowledge of files systems to properly configure.

### Back up location

It is recommended to set snapshots to save onto an external drive, or an internal drive separate from the system's boot partition. 
 - This eases the process of recovering to a previous state if the current one becomes unbootable.

 - BTRFS snapshots can only be saved onto the same device that the system's root partition is located on.

 > [!NOTE]\
> While you can select the specific drive/device to save snapshots to,`timeshift`'s default directory path on the device **cannot be changed**.

### Saved data

To save disk space, `timeshift` does not save any user files by default. 

Setting `timeshift` to save **non-system files** will use a very large amount of disk space, especially with automatic snapshots enabled.

### Snapshot limits

Once the number of snapshots reaches the set limit, `timeshift` deletes the oldest snapshot of that category. The exact amounts vary between users. Here is an example of snapshot limits:
 - 4 monthly
 - 4 weekly
 - 7 daily
 - 5 hourly
 - 5 boot

### Scheduled snapshots

Users can set up `cron` to schedule time-based jobs. 

When configured, the system automatically generates scheduled snapshots up to the set limit, and deletes old snapshots.

> [!TIP]\
> You can set up an automated process to take snapshots at scheduled intervals by enabling the `cron` scheduler. This must be manually enabled.

> See: [Enable the `cron` scheduler][cron]
