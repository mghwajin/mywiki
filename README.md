## Overview

![Endeavour OS logo and text for a dark background][eos-logo]

[Endeavour OS][eos] is a resource-light and terminal-centric Linux distribution based on [Arch Linux][arch]. It provides a beginner-friendly setup option (via the Calamares tool) along with the classic Arch installation process for power users.

Linux systems are highly customizeable but require more hands-on maintenance to run smoothly. Users should regularly:

 1. **Back up** system files

 2. **Update** important programs

 3. **Clean** out unused files

Through terminal commands, users can upgrade essential packages, obtain new program features, and ensure system stability and security.

> [!NOTE]\
> This repository is a personal reference for my setup and experience with Endeavour OS. In addition to basic wiki guides and a maintenance cheatsheet, this repo contains custom scripts that can be used as general tools and program shortcuts.

## Custom scripts

| Script  | Description           |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| [Autosave screenshot][a] | Requires `xfce4-screenshooter`. Instantly and automatically save a fullscreen screenshot with the date appended to the filename. Running this script bypasses the window waiting for filename input from the user. |
| [Convert video to MP3][b] | Requires `ffmpeg` and `thunar` file manager. Runs a custom action in `thunar` to convert a selected video file into an `.mp3` file. This script sets `ffmpeg` to use VBR (variable bit rate) for the highest possible audio quality for conversion. |

<!-- script links -->
[a]: /scripts/xfce4-screenshooter-autosave.sh
[b]: /scripts/thunar-convert-to-mp3.sh

**General tips**
- Scripts may require adjustments to function properly on your system's setup. For example, a script referencing `/home/some-username` should be edited to match your `/home/user` directory.

- Create a `/home/user/bin` directory to place your custom scripts for easy file access, consistency, and organization.

- Be sure to set the script as an executable file with the `chmod` command: `chmod +x script.sh`
